# modb-common

Can we have something like this? https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx

This project name should be change to modb-api, since it provides common apis for both internal
projects (modb,sdk-core,sdk-embed,more?) and to applications (sdk-core[depends to modb-common])

This project provides common (modb-related) classes between sdk-core, modb, and coordinator
Often these modules require intersecting classes

#### This project is used by:

## sdk-core

## sdk-embed

#### 

## sidecar
