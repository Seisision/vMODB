The DeathStar benchmark, although providing a description of the E-Commerce applcation, they do not provide the source code.

Because of that, ths projects gets inspiration from several open source projects in the e-commerce domain, including the one DeathStart used as basis (sockshop).
This project is based on several sources:

Original:

https://microservices-demo.github.io/
https://github.com/microservices-demo/

Additional:

https://github.com/helidon-sockshop/sockshop

E-commerce benchmark use by Apiary:
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo

DeathStar has microservices "user" and "discounts"

The Google benchmark does not have "user" and "discounts"

Both benchmarks do NOT check out items from catalog. As a consequence, there  is no need for replenishment.

The Google benchmark has "currency" and "emailservice" microservice, DeathStar no.
